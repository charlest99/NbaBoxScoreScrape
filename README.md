This is a set of functions to complete 3 seperate data scrapes - NBA box scores, NBA betting lines, and NBA team stats before the game was played.
The final function takes a month, day, and year, and returns a merged and cleaned dataframe. This program was used to scrape data for 10 years worth of games, and train a machine learning model to attempt to predict the spread.

Libraries used: selenium, beautifulsoup, requests, pandas
